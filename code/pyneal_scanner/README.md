**Scanner Scripts**:
These scripts are intended to be executed on the scanner itself. Transfer these scripts to the a directory on the scanner before beginning.

These tools are responsible for monitoring the directory on the scanner in which data is being written to during a scan. New data is read in, converted to a standardized format, and transmitted over a socket connection to pyneal processing further downstream.
